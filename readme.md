# Utils

Welcome to my little repo of utilities!

I've created this space to share tips and tricks I've found useful in my everyday workflows, both in the hopes of saving myself time and headaches in reproducing my own environments as well as in case these notes might help others to the same.

Hopefully some of it will be useful for you.
